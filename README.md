Just got out of the theater after watching Mountainhead and, boy, am I feeling some kind of way. I mean, I still have popcorn kernels stuck in my teeth—thanks, teeth—and my mind is ping-ponging between “what the heck was that” and “kinda brilliant, maybe?” You know that kinda movie that makes you feel like you’ve been winded up and let loose in some alternate universe where sense is optional? Yeah, that’s Mountainhead for ya.

I was a bit tired going in, which probably didn’t help. Like, why did I think an afternoon screening was a good idea again? Anyway, Mountainhead doesn’t care about your schedule or your mood. It’s like someone took a mountain and decided it needed to be an emotional rollercoaster instead. The plot? Oh, you mean the puzzle pieces tossed in a blender that somehow make a picture by the end. Not saying it was hard to follow, but I'd need the Rosetta Stone to make sure I didn't miss a thing. Not even sure I was following, but who needs clarity when you got drama and mountain metaphor-mash, right?

Some scenes hit so hard that I almost leaned over to ask the stranger next to me if we’re experiencing the same thing. The kind where you're like, “Is everyone else seeing this?” I mean, the main character—bless their tormented soul—is either a genius or just seriously needs a nap. Probably both. And the music! Like a rogue wave, it crashes over the dialogue and almost drowns it out. Not that I’m complaining, some of those lines are better lost at sea, if you catch my drift.

And don’t get me started on that mountaintop scene. I swear if I ever climb a mountain, I’ll pack more than just existential dread. Half-expecting there’s an app by now where you can download the movie vibes, except... who even uses apps for vibes? 

> Someone behind me whispered “it’s like life, but colder” which is maybe the most accurate yet ridiculous thing I've heard today. Imagine watching a dream and every frame makes sense only after it’s gone.

Oh yeah, and there was this moment where a bird—like, literally, a bird—just steals a scene. Not that they’re even supposed to be a thing in this film. But there it is, owning the sky, like “Look what I can do!” Maybe a metaphor for freedom, or just an avian cameo, who even knows. I felt like applauding the sky.

```javascript
let mountainHeadScene = (scene) => {
    return scene.includes(epic) ? wow : meh;
};
console.log(mountainHeadScene(mountain vista));
```

Anyway, if you’re in the mood for something that’ll punch your brain, and not necessarily leave you with answers, you might want to watch the movie. I don’t know if Mountainhead will ever win awards, but it's definitely something you'll think about while staring at your bedroom ceiling. Which, if we're being real, is worth more than some fancy statue sometimes.
